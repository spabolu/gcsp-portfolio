        My multidisciplinary learning experience helped me approach security
        challenges from multiple perspectives, blending technical, social, and
        entrepreneurial insights. Through coursework in{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">FSE 150</span> and{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">PAF 415</span>, I explored how engineering,
        policy, and social impact intersect to address complex security issues.

        In PAF 415 – Public Policy, I had the opportunity to develop a mobile
        app solution for St. Mary’s Food Bank, focusing on identifying security
        and operational challenges in food distribution. This project allowed me
        to explore how security concerns extend beyond just technology,
        incorporating policy and business considerations. I studied the societal
        impacts of security, examining how different sectors—public, private,
        and nonprofit—interact to address security-related issues effectively.

        PAF 415 is a required course for the Next Generation Service Corps
        (NGSC) at ASU, a leadership development program that prepares students
        to work across the private, public, and nonprofit sectors to address
        complex societal challenges. NGSC emphasizes interdisciplinary learning
        and encourages students to develop a systems mindset—one that integrates
        diverse perspectives to create effective solutions. Through this
        program, I have learned how to apply this approach within my own field
        of engineering, ensuring that the technologies and solutions I develop
        are not only technically sound but also socially responsible and
        sustainable. By bridging policy, business, and technology, NGSC has
        reinforced the importance of considering broader societal impacts when
        designing engineering solutions.

        One of the key takeaways from this experience was the importance of
        approaching security from a multidisciplinary perspective. I gained a
        deeper understanding of how engineering solutions are shaped by social
        structures, governance, and policy decisions. Working across sectors
        strengthened my ability to collaborate with different industries to
        develop security-focused solutions. More importantly, I saw how these
        concepts could be applied in practice, incorporating them into my
        Capstone project and professional experiences to improve security
        frameworks.

        This course closely aligned with my involvement in the Grand Challenge
        Scholars Program (GCSP) by integrating security, entrepreneurship, and
        societal impact. Academically, it reinforced my understanding of how
        security challenges extend beyond technical solutions and into policy
        and business. Professionally, it provided a strong foundation for
        working in security-driven environments that require complex,
        interdisciplinary problem-solving.
