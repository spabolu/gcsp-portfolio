        During the summer of 2023, I participated in the Ira A. Fulton Schools
        of Engineering Summer in Dublin program, an immersive six-week
        experience that allowed me to gain a global perspective on
        entrepreneurship, computer science, and innovation while living and
        studying in Ireland. Hosted at University College Dublin (UCD), one of
        Europe’s leading research universities and a hub for startups and tech
        innovation, this program provided an opportunity to explore the
        intersection of technology, business, and cultural influence on
        engineering solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Living and studying in Dublin, I was exposed to Ireland’s rich culture
        and entrepreneurial ecosystem, often referred to as the "Silicon Valley
        of Europe." Through interactions with Irish students and faculty, I
        gained firsthand insight into how cultural context influences business
        and technology adoption, particularly in a region that serves as the
        European base for tech giants like Google, Meta, and Amazon. Exploring
        the Silicon Docks and engaging with local entrepreneurs deepened my
        understanding of how global markets shape engineering solutions,
        reinforcing the importance of adapting technology to different economic,
        social, and regulatory environments.

      <p>
        My coursework in Dublin focused on entrepreneurship and logic, allowing
        me to apply engineering principles to both business and theoretical
        challenges. In FSE 301 - Entrepreneurship, I worked on developing
        Strive, a SaaS business, while gaining insights into market needs,
        scalability, and the role of security in tech startups. Meanwhile, in
        CSE 259 - Logic in Computer Science, I explored theoretical computer
        architecture and the calculus of computer science, including Boolean
        logic, digital gates, and hardware verification. Through hands-on coding
        in Prolog, I demonstrated these logic applications in real-world
        scenarios. These courses had a significant impact on my computer science
        degree, deepening my understanding of both the technical and
        entrepreneurial aspects of engineering and influencing my own work in
        the field.

        Additionally, my multicultural experience strongly aligned with the
        Grand Challenge Scholars Program (GCSP) by exposing me to diverse
        perspectives on engineering and culture. The program encouraged me to
        consider how cultural and regulations affect the acceptance of
        engineering solutions in different parts of the world. For instance, I
        observed how European data privacy regulations, such as GDPR, influence
        business decisions and the development of secure digital products. This
        understanding directly connects to my interest in secure technology
        development, reinforcing the need to design systems that comply with
        global security and privacy standards.

        My study abroad experience in Dublin, Ireland significantly contributed
        to my multicultural awareness, global engineering perspective, and
        professional growth. By engaging with Ireland’s tech ecosystem, local
        culture, and academic resources, I gained valuable insights into how
        engineering solutions must be adaptable, culturally aware, and globally
        scalable. These lessons will continue to influence my approach to secure
        technology development and entrepreneurship, ensuring that my work is
        not only technically sound but also aligned with diverse global needs.
