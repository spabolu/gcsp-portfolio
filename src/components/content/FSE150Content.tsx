        My multidisciplinary learning experience helped me approach security
        challenges from multiple perspectives, blending technical, social, and
        entrepreneurial insights. Through coursework in{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">FSE 150</span> and{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">PAF 415</span>, I explored how engineering,
        policy, and social impact intersect to address complex security issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        In FSE 150 – Engineering Solutions & Social Impact, I explored the NAE's
        Grand Challenges, gaining a deeper understanding of how engineering can
        address global security concerns. The course involved analyzing
        real-world case studies to see how security issues are tackled through
        multidisciplinary approaches. Beyond the technical aspects, I examined
        the broader societal implications of engineering decisions, bridging the
        gap between technology and its impact on communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        These experiences helped shape my ability to approach security from
        multiple perspectives. I learned how engineering solutions are
        influenced by social structures, governance, and policy decisions,
        giving me a more comprehensive view of security challenges. The course
        also reinforced the importance of cross-sector collaboration,
        strengthening my ability to work across different industries to develop
        security-focused solutions. More importantly, I saw how these concepts
        apply in practice, incorporating them into my Capstone project and
        professional experiences to enhance security frameworks.

        Beyond the coursework, I really enjoyed the presentations given by guest
        speakers like Dr. Chavez and others, who shared insights into their
        research fields. Dr. Chavez, in particular, highlighted the importance
        of human-computer interaction, especially in today’s world, where
        technology plays a role in nearly every aspect of our lives. She spoke
        passionately about her research on using human senses—beyond just
        touch—to predict and understand human behavior when interacting with
        technology. The lessons I gained from these guest speakers were
        incredibly valuable, and I carried them into my coursework, especially
        in CSE 463: Human-Computer Interaction. These talks deepened my interest
        in technology and gave me a real-world perspective on the latest
        research happening at ASU. Hearing directly from professors conducting
        cutting-edge studies provided a meaningful connection between academic
        concepts and their practical applications.

        FSE 150 opened my eyes to various opportunities beyond my engineering
        degree. Through this course, I learned about the GCSP Experiential
        Grant, which helped cover my study abroad expenses. It also introduced
        me to a community of like-minded peers who shared similar interests.
        Many of them became friends, and we attended GCSP events together,
        further strengthening our connections and engagement with the program.
      </p>
      <p>
        This course aligned closely with my involvement in the Grand Challenge
        Scholars Program (GCSP), integrating themes of security,
        entrepreneurship, and societal impact. Academically, it deepened my
        understanding of how security challenges extend beyond just technology,
        intersecting with policy and business considerations. Professionally, it
        provided a strong foundation for working in security-driven environments
        where multidisciplinary problem-solving is essential.
