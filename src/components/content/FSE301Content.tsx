        My entrepreneurial journey has been shaped by both academic coursework
        and hands-on startup experience, allowing me to develop solutions that
        meet market demands while incorporating security-focused principles.
        Through FSE 301, I gained valuable insights into opportunity
        recognition, value creation, and business development—skills that I
        later applied to my own ventures.
      </p>

      <p>
        In FSE 301 – Entrepreneurship & Value Creation, I developed Strive, an
        AI-powered fitness companion, refining strategies for customer
        engagement and product development. I conducted extensive market and
        pricing research, analyzing user behavior to improve product viability
        and drive business growth. Additionally, I learned how to avoid common
        startup pitfalls, gaining key risk mitigation strategies essential for
        securing long-term success.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my biggest takeaways from this experience was recognizing the
        importance of integrating security into product development, especially
        in AI-driven applications like Strive. I explored data protection and
        ethical AI, focusing on privacy-preserving techniques to safeguard user
        data. Understanding scalability and risk management also helped me apply
        strategies to mitigate both business and security risks in new tech
        ventures.
      </p>
      <p>
        While not part of FSE 301, the principles I learned in the course
        provided a strong foundation for designing my own SaaS project,

          href="https://courseer.co"
        >
          Courseer
        </a>
        . Applying my knowledge of market research, secure data handling, and
        scalable product growth, I ensured that Courseer prioritized data
        privacy, secure transactions, and user authentication—key elements of
        security-focused solutions in tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        This experience helped me bridge the gap between entrepreneurship and
        security, integrating security principles into business and product
        development. I applied real-world problem-solving techniques to build
        secure, scalable tech solutions and strengthened my cross-disciplinary
        growth by connecting business, technology, and security—reinforcing my
        GCSP competencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work in this course aligned with my involvement in the Grand
        Challenge Scholars Program (GCSP), enhancing my ability to develop
        impactful solutions at the intersection of business and security.
        Academically, I gained hands-on experience in business strategy,
        customer development, and product security. Professionally, I applied
        entrepreneurial skills to both Strive and Courseer, shaping my approach
        to secure software development.
      </p>

        I had the unique opportunity to take this course in Ireland during my
        Summer 2023 study abroad with Professor Kennedy, which provided
        additional international perspectives on entrepreneurship and
        innovation.
