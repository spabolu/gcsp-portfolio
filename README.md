## Summary of GCSP Experiences

This portfolio summarizes my work across the five competencies of the Grand Challenge Scholars Program, with a focus on the theme of **Security**.

- **Talent/Research (Capstone & SolarSpell):**
  - Designed and developed a secure, full-stack property management system for a commercial client, focusing on data integrity, secure authentication (JWT, role-based access control), and scalable deployment on AWS.
  - Interned with SolarSPELL, creating secure, accessible offline digital libraries on Raspberry Pi devices for communities with limited internet, adapting technology to cultural and infrastructural constraints in regions like South Africa.

- **Multidisciplinary (FSE 150 & PAF 415):**
  - Explored the intersection of engineering, public policy, and social impact.
  - Developed a mobile app concept for St. Maryâ€™s Food Bank to address operational and security challenges in food distribution.

- **Viable Business/Entrepreneurship (FSE 301):**
  - Developed business plans for tech ventures, including an AI fitness companion (`Strive`) and a SaaS platform (`Courseer`), focusing on market research, product development, and integrating security-by-design principles.

- **Multicultural/Global Perspective (Study Abroad in Ireland):**
  - Gained a global perspective on technology and entrepreneurship during a study abroad program in Dublin, Ireland. Studied the impact of cultural contexts and regulations like GDPR on tech innovation.

- **Social Consciousness/Service Learning (EPICS):**
  - Contributed to two community-focused projects: `Stardust`, a project to refurbish used solar panels, and `Headcount`, a system for monitoring room occupancy for public safety using computer vision, with a strong emphasis on data privacy and ethics.
